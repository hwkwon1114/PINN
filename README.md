# PINN Study Sessions: From Heat Equations to Nonlinear Pendulums

This repository documents our learning journey with Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), exploring their capabilities across different physical systems. Our goal was to understand how PINNs combine neural networks with physics-based loss functions to solve differential equations using minimal data.

## What We've Learned

### 1. Heat Equation Implementation

#### 1D Heat Equation
We started with the one-dimensional heat equation:

```
∂u/∂t = α * ∂²u/∂x²
```
where:
- u(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t
- α is the thermal diffusivity coefficient
- ∂u/∂t represents the rate of change of temperature with time
- ∂²u/∂x² represents the spatial second derivative

#### 2D Heat Equation
We then extended our understanding to the two-dimensional case:

```
∂u/∂t = α * (∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)
```
where:
- u(x,y,t) is the temperature at position (x,y) and time t
- The additional term ∂²u/∂y² accounts for heat diffusion in the y-direction

Key learnings from heat equations:
- The 1D heat equation helped us understand basic PINN architecture
- Extending to 2D demonstrated the scalability of the approach
- These simpler cases provided a solid foundation for understanding how physics-based loss functions work

### 2. Nonlinear Pendulum Challenge
Moving to the nonlinear pendulum equation:

```
θ'' + (g/l) * sin(θ) = 0
```
where:
- θ is the angle of the pendulum
- g is the gravitational acceleration
- l is the length of the pendulum

This presented new challenges:
- Initial attempts showed rapid decay despite the undamped physics
- Multiple iterations were needed to achieve stability
- Successfully achieved short-term stability but faced challenges with long-term predictions
- Learned the importance of proper boundary condition handling

2. Training Dynamics
   - PINNs can work with remarkably little data when physics constraints are well-defined
   - Boundary conditions significantly impact solution stability
   - Long-term prediction remains challenging even with adding loss functions for energy conservation and physics. 

3. Architecture Considerations
   - Network depth and width affect solution quality
   - Choice of activation functions matters for different physical systems
   - Proper initialization can be crucial for convergence

## Areas for Improvement
